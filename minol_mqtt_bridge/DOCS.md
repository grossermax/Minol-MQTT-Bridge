# Minol MQTT Bridge

This add-on retrieves your consumption data (heating, hot water, cold water) from the Minol Customer Portal and
publishes it to Home Assistant via MQTT.

It logs in securely via the Minol portal's Azure B2C (SAML) sign-in and fetches the latest data available in your
account.

## Prerequisites

* You must have a valid account for the [Minol Customer Portal](https://webservices.minol.com).
* You need an MQTT Broker installed and configured in Home Assistant (e.g., the official **Mosquitto broker** add-on).

## Installation & Setup

1. Ensure your MQTT Broker is running.
2. Install this add-on from the add-on store.
3. Go to the **Configuration** tab.
4. Enter your Minol **email** and **password**.
5. Configure the MQTT connection settings (usually, the defaults work if you use the official Mosquitto broker).
6. Start the add-on.

## Sensors

Sensors are automatically created via **MQTT Auto-Discovery**. After the first successful run, you can find them here:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
2. Click on the **MQTT** integration.
3. Look for a device named **Minol Customer Portal**.

The add-on creates total consumption sensors as well as individual sensors for every radiator or water meter found in
your account.
